**This is an original idea, although inspired on other titles, it is
an original project**

Quantum Odyssey is a game where you can be anything you put your mind to.
Want to settle on a distant world and build a colony? You can do that.
Want to be a pirate and steal from other players? You can do that.
Want to be a trader and make money? You can do that.
Want to be a bounty hunter and hunt down pirates? You can do that.
You get the idea. Now get out there and explore the universe!

Updates are ongoing, and likely will be for a long time. This is a
project that I am doing on my own, so it will take a while to complete.

I will post code publically in a seperate repository once the game is
released.
